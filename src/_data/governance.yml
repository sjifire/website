  San Juan Island Fire and Rescue is governed by San Juan County Fire District

  1959.


  In Washington, special purpose districts are limited purpose local governments separate from a city, town, or county government. They perform functions including fire protection and emergency medical services that are not otherwise available from city or county governments.

  Fire District #3 operates as directed by applicable laws and regulations set by the Revised Code of Washington (RCW) and the Washington Administrative Code (WAC).
