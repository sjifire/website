      "copy": "In Washington, special purpose districts are limited purpose **local governments** separate from a city, town, or county government. Generally, they perform limited functions including fire protection, that are not otherwise available from city or county governments.\n\nSan Juan County Fire District 3 has an elected, three member board of commissioners. Most special purpose districts in Washington, including San Juan County District 3, derive revenues from real property assessments and are called taxing districts.  \n\nFire District #3 operates as directed by applicable laws and regulations set by the Revised Code of Washington (RCW) and the Washington Administrative Code (WAC).\n\nThe RCW is the compilation of all permanent laws now in force. It is a collection of Session Laws (enacted by the Legislature, and signed by the Governor, or enacted via the initiative process). The WAC includes the regulations of executive branch agencies issued by authority of statutes. Like legislation and the Constitution, *regulations are a source of primary law* in Washington State. The WAC codifies the regulations and arranges them by subject or agency."
