Most of our members are dual trained Firefighters and EMTs. We work closely with our neighboring fire districts, San Juan Island EMS, the San Juan County’s [sheriff’s department](https://www.sanjuanco.com/344/Sheriff), as well as state and federal emergency services agencies.\n\nAs needed, we provide fire response to other non-ferry served islands through a contract with the Washington State Department of Natural Resources ([DNR](https://www.dnr.wa.gov/FightingFire)), fire services .  SJIF&R participates in the [Statewide Mobilization Plan](http://www.wsp.wa.gov/all-risk-mobilization/) and provides mutual aid to neighboring fire districts, as those districts provide mutual aid for our district\n\n### Ethos"

We perform with integrity, honesty, and compassion inside and outside the department, staying above the fray.  \n\nOne of the key principles for us is compassion. It is critical to show empathy for our community, our visitors, and fellow responders. We may not be experiencing the same thing as another, we *definitely* can take a moment to understand what they are going through. Remember to “seek first to understand; then be understood” (Covey, 1989).\n\n### Stations and equipment\n\nThere are six fire stations on San Juan Island, and there is a station on Brown Island. San Juan Island Fire and Rescue operates a satellite station on Pearl Island and is staging emergency response equipment on Stuart and Henry Islands. San Juan Island Fire and Rescue provides marine fire, rescue and emergency medical transport to our district, and as needed for all San Juan County Islands.\n\n### Governance\n\nSan Juan Island Fire and Rescue is governed by San Juan County Fire District 3. The state of Washington chartered San Juan Island Fire Department in May of 1959.  See our [Governance Page](/governance) for details."
