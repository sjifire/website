  ## Overview

  SJIF&R follows a national standard around logging and grouping of incident
  data, as defined by the [National Fire Incident Reporting
  System](https://www.usfa.fema.gov/nfirs/).

  ## Definitions

  * An Incident is an emergency call to 911.  This includes all calls to 911
  within our district as well as out-of-district incidents which we responded
  to.
  * All statistics are for the past 30 days unless noted otherwise.
  * Only incidents which are finished and have had all the paperwork finalized
  are included.  The vast majority of incident reports are finished within a few
  hours, though larger, more complicated, multi-day incident reports, such as
  for wildland fires, may take upwards of 96 hours to complete.
  * All time statistics are averages over the past 30 days, rounded to the
  nearest minute.
  * Times are logged by dispatch from communication over a single radio
  frequency, which can cause the logging of times to be delayed if the airway is
  clogged with voice traffic.

  ### Field Definitions

  * **Total Incidents:**
    * **Medical & Rescue:** Calls that have a medical component, ranging from a simple lift assists to more complicated medical calls such as cardiac or overdoses, to car accidents, search & rescue, rope rescues, and more.
    * **Fire & Other:** Calls that have a fire or infrastructure component, such as fire alarms, structure and wildland fires, Alarm Systsem activations, water leaks, etc.  This also includes standby, downgraded, and cancelled calls.
    * **Daytime Incidents:** A 12-hour period from 6am to 6pm
    * **Nighttime Incidents:** A 12-hour period from 6pm through to 6am.
    * **Overlapping Incidents:** If one or more additional incidents are triggered while another incident is in progress.
    * **Number of Incidents:**: The total number of incidents
    * **Number of Incidents in the Past Year:** The total number of incidents within the trailing 365 days
  * **Responders:**
    * **Total Time on Incidents:** The total amount of time that individual responders spent on incidents
    * **Number of Unique Responders on Incidents:**  How many responders responded to one or more incidents
    * **Max Responders on an Incident:** The maximum number of responders on a single incident.
  * **Incident Times:**
    * **Reaction Time:** When a crew is ready to go to work and is in a moving apparatus, dispatch logs an **[En Route Time]**.  The 'Reaction Time' is the time from when Dispatch sends out a page **[Dispatched Time]** to when the crew is En Route.
    * **Travel Time:**  The amount of time between when an apparatus when en route and when it has arrived on scene **[Arrived Time]**.  These times are broken out based upon the incident regions, which roughly correspond to:
      * **Central:** The central part of the island, from a rough line around Egg Lake Road to Friday Harbor.
      * **North:** North of Egg Lake Road out to Roche Harbor and beyond.
      * **South:** South and West of Town, along Cattle Pt. Rd. and Bailer Hill.
    * **On Scene Time:** How much time was spent on an active Scene, which is the difference between the **[Arrived Time]** and the **[Clear Time]**.  This does not include cleanup and restocking of equipment and apparatus.
    * **Total Incident Time:**The total amount of time of an incident, from the **[Dispatched Time]** to when the last apparatus **[Clear Time]**.

  ### Understanding Incident Lifecycle

  Everytime a call is made to 911, it follows a standardized set of steps to
  make sure the right resources are sent to you in a timely and safe manner.

  During an incident, certain key events are logged and time stamped by
  dispatch.  They're noted as **[Event Time]**


  1. Dispatch received a 911 call **[Alarm Time]**
  1. Dispatch notifies SJIF&R of an incident via a "page" over the radio.
  **[Dispatched Time]**
  1. The on-duty crew responds **[En Route Time]**
  1. Dispatch gives a 'short' description of the event and additional pertinent
  information they've received from the reporting party.
  1. If needed, the on-duty crew officer, or one of the command officers who are
  always monitoring, may request additional resources, based upon the type of
  call and subsequent information from Dispatch
  1. Upon arrival, the first unit may give a 'size up' of the scene ("car on its
  side, non-blocking, no one in the vehicle"). They may request additional
  resources based upon what they see. **[Arrived Time]**
  1. If additional resources have been requested, SJIF&R members travel to their
  assigned stations, and may go en route to the scene, or stand by in quarters
  awaiting instruction
  1. On an incident, there is always an incident commander, regardless whether
  it is short incident only requiring two or three responders, or it requires
  dozens of responders over multiple hours, there is always someone in control.
  1. If responders are no longer needed, whether they are traveling or already
  on scene, they are prompty cleared. **[Clear Time]**
  1. apparatus may need to be cleaned and restocked before they are available to
  respond for the next call. **[Out/In Service Time]**
