  "body": "**OPEN HOUSE UPDATE**\n\nSan Juan Island Fire and Rescue is **POSTPONING** the Open House at our Headquarters Station on Mullis Street with a future date to be determined.\n\nDue to an overabundance of caution, we need to reschedule the Open House because of the rise of COVID in our community.  While we are disappointed that we can't see everyone this weekend, protecting our community is our number one priority.\n\nWe are planning to have a crew and our crisis response canines at the upcoming County Fair.  Hopefully, we will be able to reschedule the Open House before then, though.\n\nPlease take care of your family, friends, and yourself by maintaining an awareness of your surroundings and others. Consider wearing a mask in group settings and small environments."
