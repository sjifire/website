  see but are still critical to a smoothly running emergency response system.

When the page came in for a marine rescue call described in a [previous post](/blog/2021-12-01-emergency-response-moments-boat-rescue), I was in a farm field.  This was the page for two kids on a paddle board that were being pulled out to the sound on a tide, though no one knew for sure because they lost sight of them on the choppy water.  

When you hear a page for a boat call, you know they’ll need resources to augment the on-duty crew, so I quickly moved out of the field, grabbing fire and medical gear bags from the equipment shed, keys from the house, and then I was able to hit the road.  You never know what the call will morph into, so you always schlep all of the gear.  

The emergency response boat is moored at the Friday Harbor Marina.  I parked, grabbed my bags, and briskly walked towards the boat.  The boat engines were warming up and I could see 4 people bustling around getting the boat ready for a quick departure.  I moved faster.

But not fast enough.  I was 50 ft away when the mooring lines were released and the boat started to pull out.  I hollered if they needed an extra, and they waved, hollered back ‘Sorry, but we’re hustling to go get those kids.  We’re good, but standby in station!’, and off they went into the choppy water.

Dang it to heck!  I checked my watch, and it was about 9 minutes from the time the page started to standing there, left on the dock.

But here’s the thing.  Roughly 20% of our calls or more, depending on the season, come in while another call is in progresses.   On calls that tie up resources for a while, such as this call which took roughly two hours to complete, others come to the station to cover. So off I went to join the team at the station, and we got our gear on the backup rig and stood by in station.

It was quiet while the boat was out on call, yet if something did happen, we would have been out the door in 90 seconds, ready to go to work, whatever the emergency.
