      "copy": "This is not anything new; SJIF&R has provided personnel——staff, volunteers, & instructors——as well as trauma, rescue, and marine medical services to the district and county for 30 years. \n\nAs we prepared to proceed with the approved consolidation of EMS services by SJIF&R and SJIPHD#1, in  2019, we received an EMS aid license from the state. SJIF&R already has eight registered aid vehicles in operation, providing 24/7 EMS response to the district and region. \n\nThere is no threat that EMS will not be provided to our district residents. If needed for any reason, SJIF&R is positioned to expand emergency response to include transport and advanced life support (ALS) services. The San Juan County Medical Program Director overseeing EMS agencies in the county is fully supportive. \n\nSJIF&R is fully committed to providing swift and competent emergency medical responses in our district--and when needed, in neighboring districts that call for mutual aid.  \n\nNo levy or ballot measure can destroy or dismantle emergency medical services on San Juan Island. EMS is a robust, cooperative, essential system and it's here to stay. \n\n\n### FACTS:\n\n* Fire/ Rescue is a licensed Emergency Services Agency (#61002894) providing pre-hospital care with the most certified EMTs and instructors/evaluators in the district.\n* SJIF&R's current aid license does not include advanced life support nor transport licenses, but it can be quickly upgraded by the state in case of community need.  \n* There are 6 EMS agencies in the County, and 2 in this district, one of which is SJIF&R.\n* Medical Program Directors, [past](https://www.facebook.com/SJIFire/posts/4454762484635174?comment_id=4457600614351361) and [present](https://sanjuanupdate.com/dr-joshua-corsa-for-fire-district-ems-levy/), believe a combined response model is the best for patients, outcomes, and volunteers.  \n* SJIF&R has responded to 999 aid calls in calendar year 2021; 63% of those were medical & rescue related.\n* SJIF&R's current leaders have over 83 years of EMS expertise as EMTs and Paramedics; as EMS instructors for large regions and at the National Academy; and as directors and chiefs overseeing EMS departments ranging from small communities like ours to large metro districts.  They have a century of governance experience managing emergency services organizations. See [Governance page](/about/governance) for details."
