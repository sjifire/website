We are here to serve you and provide education, fire prevention tools and when needed, emergency response. SJIF&R trains extensively, year-round and we are prepared to serve our islands’ communities 24-hours a day, 7 days a week.

Our elected Board of Commissioners have regularly scheduled public meetings and I encourage you to attend our meetings or to review meeting minutes and actions on this website. You will find this under the Governance tab. Our district and all activities – governance, financial and operational activities are always available for review and discussion.

We strive to provide emergency service response in a way that is sustainable and affordable, to meet the needs of our citizens and taxpayers. I always welcome your ideas, and feedback. Please let us know how we are doing as we strive to constantly improve our service.

All of us at SJIF&R are dedicated to always doing the right thing for our islands’ residents, being ready to respond to any emergency and we are always proud and honored to be at your service. We live in a unique environment with many rewards and challenges. As neighbors in our wonderful islands’ communities, we are all in this together.

Thank you always for your support.
