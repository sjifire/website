We believe in transparency. These statistics show our response activity and help us identify ways to better serve San Juan Island.

## What the Numbers Mean

- **Calls:** Every 911 call in our district or mutual aid request we respond to.
- **Reaction Time:** How quickly we get our crew ready and vehicles moving after dispatch notifies us.
- **Travel Time:** How long it takes to reach the scene once we're on the road. Broken out by region:
  - *Central:* Friday Harbor area north to around Egg Lake Road
  - *South:* South and west of town, along Cattle Point and Bailer Hill
  - *North:* North of Egg Lake Road out to Roche Harbor
- **Responder Time on Calls:** Total time our responders spent on active incidents.
- **Unique Responders:** Number of individual responders who responded to one or more calls.

All times shown are the median (typical) value over the past 30 days. Data is updated daily from [ESO](https://www.eso.com/), our incident reporting system, and only includes completed incidents.
