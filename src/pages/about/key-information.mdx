## Our History

San Juan Island Fire & Rescue was established in **1958** under RCW Chapter 52 as a volunteer fire department serving the rural areas of San Juan Island outside the Town of Friday Harbor. The Town of Friday Harbor had its own fire department, founded in 1909.

In **2011**, Friday Harbor Fire Department merged operations with Fire District #3 through an interlocal agreement, consolidating fire services across the island under unified command.

In **April 2021**, voters formally annexed the Town of Friday Harbor into Fire District #3, completing the unification by bringing governance and funding under a single agency.

Today, we operate as a combination department with both career staff and volunteers, proudly serving nine islands: San Juan, Brown, Dinner, Henry, Johns, Pearl, Spieden, Stuart, and O'Neil.
