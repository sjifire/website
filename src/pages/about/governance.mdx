San Juan Island Fire and Rescue is governed by San Juan County Fire District #3. The state of Washington chartered San Juan Island Fire Department in May of 1959.

In Washington, special purpose districts are limited purpose local governments separate from a city, town, or county government. They perform functions including fire protection and emergency medical services that are not otherwise available from city or county governments.

San Juan County Fire District #3 has an elected, three-member Board of Fire Commissioners who serve six-year terms ([RCW 52.14.060](https://app.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=52.14.060)). The district derives revenues from real property assessments and is classified as a taxing district.

Fire District #3 operates as directed by applicable laws and regulations set by the Revised Code of Washington (RCW) and the Washington Administrative Code (WAC).

### Current Commissioners

* **Dwight Colley** (Chair)
