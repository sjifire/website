## When to Call 911

**Always call 911 for emergencies.** Don't hesitate—we'd rather respond and find a minor situation than have you delay calling during a true emergency.

Call 911 immediately for:

* **Fire or smoke** in a building, vehicle, or wildland area
* **Medical emergencies** including chest pain, difficulty breathing, severe bleeding, or unconsciousness
* **Vehicle accidents** with injuries or hazardous conditions
* **Water emergencies** including boats in distress, swimmers in trouble, or marine accidents
* **Hazardous materials** including gas leaks, chemical spills, or suspicious odors
* **Rescue situations** where someone is trapped or in danger

**Stay on the line** with the dispatcher until they tell you it's okay to hang up. They may provide life-saving instructions while help is on the way.

## Our Emergency Services

### Structural and Wildland Firefighting

Our firefighters are trained to combat fires in buildings, homes, and outdoor environments. San Juan Island's mix of residential areas, forests, and grasslands requires expertise in both structural firefighting techniques and wildland fire suppression.

We respond to:
* House and building fires
* Chimney fires
* Vehicle fires
* Brush and grass fires
* Wildland fires threatening structures

Our personnel maintain certifications in structural firefighting, wildland firefighting, and the Incident Command System (ICS) to ensure coordinated, effective responses.

### Vehicle Extrication

When motor vehicle accidents result in trapped occupants, our crews are equipped and trained to perform technical rescue operations. Using hydraulic rescue tools (commonly known as the "Jaws of Life"), spreaders, cutters, and other specialized equipment, we work quickly and safely to free trapped individuals.

SJIF&R responds to vehicle accidents throughout the island, often working alongside San Juan Island EMS to provide immediate medical care while extrication is underway.

### Search and Rescue

SJIF&R participates in search and rescue operations on San Juan Island, working in coordination with the San Juan County Sheriff's Department and other agencies. Our personnel are trained in:

* Ground search techniques
* Water-based search operations
* Technical rope rescue
* Swift water rescue basics

Our island environment presents unique challenges, and our team trains regularly to handle searches in varied terrain—from dense forests to rocky shorelines.

### Level 1 HAZMAT Response

As a Level 1 HAZMAT (Hazardous Materials) response agency, SJIF&R is trained to identify hazardous materials, establish safe perimeters, and take defensive actions to protect the public. Common HAZMAT responses include:

* Natural gas leaks
* Carbon monoxide alarms
* Fuel spills
* Unknown substance investigations

For more complex hazardous materials incidents, we coordinate with regional HAZMAT teams and the Washington State Department of Ecology.

### Marine Response

As an island community surrounded by the waters of the Salish Sea, marine emergencies are a critical part of our mission. SJIF&R operates marine response vessels capable of reaching incidents throughout our waterways.

Our marine response capabilities include:
* Boat fires
* Vessels in distress
* Water rescue operations
* Medical emergencies on the water
* Support for US Coast Guard operations

We maintain close working relationships with US Coast Guard Station Bellingham and other maritime agencies to ensure rapid, coordinated responses to marine emergencies.
