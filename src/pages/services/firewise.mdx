**We respond to wildland fires every year within our district.** While we've been fortunate to contain them quickly, conditions are changing. The best defense for your home starts with you.

## Protect Your Home Before Fire Strikes

[Firewise USA](https://www.nfpa.org/education-and-research/wildfire/firewise-usa) is a national program that helps homeowners create defensible space around their property. Simple actions—clearing brush, trimming branches, choosing fire-resistant landscaping—can make the difference between a home that survives and one that doesn't.

**28 communities on San Juan Island are already Firewise-certified.** Is yours?
