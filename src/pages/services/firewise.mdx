**We respond to wildland fires every year within our district.** While we've been fortunate to contain them quickly, conditions are changing. According to the [2025 San Juan County Community Wildfire Protection Plan](https://www.sanjuanislandscd.org/wildfire-preparedness), **78% of structures in the county** are in areas where they could be ignited by adjacent vegetation or flying embers.

The best defense for your home starts with you.

## Protect Your Home Before Fire Strikes

[Firewise USA](https://www.nfpa.org/education-and-research/wildfire/firewise-usa) is a national program that helps homeowners create defensible space around their property. Simple actions—clearing brush, trimming branches, choosing fire-resistant landscaping—can make the difference between a home that survives and one that doesn't.

**San Juan County has 33 Firewise communities—more than half of Washington state's total.** Is your neighborhood one of them?
