Working smoke and CO alarms save lives. Two-thirds of fatal fires occur in homes without working alarms.

**If your alarm sounds:** Get everyone outside, call 911, and stay outside—even if you can't smell or see anything. We'll be there shortly. Plan ahead with your family on where to meet, like your driveway or a neighbor's yard.

## Smoke Alarms

Smoke spreads faster than flames. A working alarm gives you and your family time to escape. Half of home fire deaths occur between 11 p.m. and 7 a.m. when people are asleep—your alarm is your first line of defense.

## Carbon Monoxide Alarms

Carbon Monoxide (CO) is colorless, odorless, and deadly. Common sources include generators, gas appliances, fireplaces, and vehicles. You cannot smell or sense CO—[generators are a leading cause of death](https://www.propublica.org/article/carbon-monoxide-from-generators-poisons-thousands-of-people-a-year-the-u-s-has-failed-to-force-safety-changes) during power outages.

**We recommend combination smoke/CO alarms.** Modern UL or ETL-certified combination detectors work well when properly installed.

## Installation & Maintenance

1. **Location:** Install alarms in every bedroom, outside each sleeping area, and on every level of your home. Keep alarms at least 10 feet from stoves to reduce false alarms.
2. **Test monthly:** Press the test button to ensure it's working
3. **Check expiration dates:** Look on the back of each alarm for the manufacture or expiration date. Per [NFPA guidelines](https://www.nfpa.org/education-and-research/home-fire-safety/smoke-alarms), replace smoke alarms 10 years from manufacture. CO alarms have shorter lifespans—typically 7-10 years depending on the model. If your alarm chirps every 30 seconds or shows "ERR" or "END," it has reached end-of-life and must be replaced immediately.
4. **Change batteries yearly:** A good reminder is when you change your clocks in fall
