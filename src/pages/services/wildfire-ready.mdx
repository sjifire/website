San Juan Island Fire & Rescue is proud to be a founding partner of the [Wildfire Ready Neighbors](https://wildfireready.dnr.wa.gov/) program in San Juan County. In May 2024, we hosted the official county launch at our fire station, bringing together Washington State Department of Natural Resources (DNR), fire districts from across the San Juan Islands, emergency management, the National Park Service, and the San Juan Islands Conservation District.

## What is Wildfire Ready Neighbors?

Wildfire Ready Neighbors is a free program created by Washington State DNR to help homeowners prepare their properties for wildfire. The program was developed after the devastating 2020 Labor Day fires, when more than 500,000 acres burned across Washington State in less than 36 hours.

The program provides:

* **A personalized Wildfire Ready Plan** tailored to your property
* **Free home visits** with local wildfire experts who assess your property's risk
* **Actionable recommendations** to increase your home's chance of surviving a wildfire
* **Local resources** and connections to community programs

Since 2021, Wildfire Ready Neighbors has grown to serve 21 counties across Washington. The program has enrolled nearly 7,000 neighbors statewide, with over 3,800 requesting in-person home visits or forest health consultations, resulting in nearly 35,000 property improvement actions. Since launching in San Juan County in May 2024, more than 500 local residents have already received their free action plans.

## Why Does This Matter for San Juan County?

> "The San Juan Islands face a unique challenge as they are a designated wildland-urban interface, where our homes and development intersect with undeveloped and often dry wildland, creating a dangerous situation."
> — **Commissioner of Public Lands Hilary Franz**, at the San Juan County launch

The San Juan Islands are classified as a wildland-urban interface (WUI), placing our 18,000 residents in what FEMA considers an "at-risk community." Our forests are dangerously overstocked, averaging 400-500 tree stems per acre compared to a healthy 30-50 stems per acre. According to the San Juan Islands Conservation District, there are approximately 3 million tons of excess biomass in the islands, with 540,000 tons in the wildland-urban interface.

Every year, wildfires occur in the San Juan Islands. While our firefighters and DNR crews have successfully contained these fires, conditions are changing. Fire seasons have lengthened dramatically since 1973, and the average area burned in the Pacific Northwest is projected to more than triple by the 2040s.

Taking action now can:

* Significantly reduce the risk of losing your home to wildfire
* Protect your family and neighbors
* Give firefighters a better chance of defending your property
* Lower insurance costs in some cases

## How Does the Program Work?

### Step 1: Sign Up

Visit [wildfireready.dnr.wa.gov](https://wildfireready.dnr.wa.gov/) to create your free account and answer questions about your property.

### Step 2: Receive Your Wildfire Ready Plan

Based on your responses, you'll receive a personalized action plan with prioritized recommendations specific to your home and property.

### Step 3: Request a Home Visit (Optional)

You can request a free on-site consultation where a local wildfire expert will walk your property with you, identify specific risks, and provide tailored guidance.

### Step 4: Take Action

Work through your action plan at your own pace. Many actions are simple and low-cost, such as clearing debris from gutters, moving firewood away from structures, or trimming vegetation.

## Understanding Defensible Space

Creating defensible space around your home is one of the most effective ways to protect it from wildfire. Defensible space is divided into three zones:

<StyledImage src="/assets/media/defensible_space_zones.jpg" alt="Aerial diagram showing the three defensible space zones around a home: Zone 0 (0-5 feet), Zone 1 (5-30 feet), and Zone 2 (30-100 feet)" align="center" />

### Zone 0: Ember-Resistant Zone (0-5 feet)

The area immediately surrounding your home is the most critical. Embers landing here can ignite your home directly.

* Use non-combustible materials like gravel, pavers, or concrete
* Remove dead vegetation and debris
* Keep gutters and roofs clear of leaves and needles
* Move combustible patio furniture away during fire season

### Zone 1: Lean, Clean, and Green (5-30 feet)

This zone creates a buffer that slows fire spread and reduces flame height.

* Maintain well-watered, low-growing plants
* Space shrubs at least twice their height apart
* Remove "ladder fuels" (vegetation that allows fire to climb into trees)
* Keep trees pruned so the lowest branches are 6-10 feet above ground

### Zone 2: Reduced Fuel Zone (30-100 feet)

This extended zone interrupts the fire's path and keeps flames small and on the ground.

* Create spacing between tree canopies (12 feet for trees 30-60 feet from home)
* Remove dead trees and shrubs
* Clear ground debris and keep grass cut short
