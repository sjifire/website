Locked doors can delay emergency response. A [KnoxBox](https://www.knoxbox.com) is a high-security, UL-listed key safe that allows first responders to quickly enter your home, business, or gate without forced entry.

Each KnoxBox is keyed specifically for San Juan Island Fire & Rescue—only we have access.

## How to Order

1. Visit the [KnoxBox Products](https://www.knoxbox.com/Products) page
2. Select **Washington State**, enter **San Juan Co**, then choose **San Juan Co Fire Dist #3**
3. Choose your product: select "Residential Use ONLY - HomeBoxes" for a single-key home box, or the other option for businesses and multi-key needs
4. Complete your order—we'll be notified automatically and will contact you if needed
5. When your KnoxBox arrives, mount it and call us at **(360) 378-5334** to schedule a visit to finalize setup
