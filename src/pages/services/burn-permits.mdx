**Outdoor burning is a leading cause of wildfires in Washington State.** Every year, escaped burn piles start fires that threaten homes and wildlands in San Juan County. Following burn regulations protects your property, your neighbors, and our firefighters.

## Current Burn Status

The burn status tells you when outdoor burning is allowed:

* **Open** — Permitted and recreational fires allowed
* **Closed** — No permitted burns; recreational fires may still be allowed
* **Burn Ban** — No outdoor burning of any kind

**Fireworks are banned throughout San Juan County year-round.**

## Do I Need a Permit?

**Recreational campfires** — No permit required, but size restrictions and fuel requirements apply. During restricted periods, only gas-fueled appliances may be allowed.

**Residential burns** — Permit required for burning yard debris and brush piles. Permits are valid for the burn season and have specific requirements for pile size and suppression equipment.

**Commercial burns** — Permit required for large-scale vegetation clearing. An on-site inspection is required before the permit can be issued.

The [San Juan County Fire Marshal](https://www.sanjuanco.com/1096/Open-Burn-Info) maintains current requirements for all burn types.

## Your Responsibilities

When you burn, you're responsible for:

* Knowing and following all permit conditions
* Checking the current burn status before you light
* Having proper suppression equipment on-site
* Controlling the fire until it's completely out

**If your fire escapes, you may be liable for suppression costs** — regardless of whether you're the permit holder or property owner. The person attending the burn is responsible.

## State and National Parks

Parks may suspend all burning during high-risk conditions — including BBQs and gas grills. Check with park rangers before planning outdoor fires during fire season.
