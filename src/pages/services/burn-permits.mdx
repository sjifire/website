**Outdoor burning is a leading cause of wildfires in Washington State.** Every year, escaped burn piles start fires that threaten homes and wildlands in San Juan County. Following burn regulations protects your property, your neighbors, and our firefighters.

## Current Burn Status

Understanding the burn status levels helps you know when and what you can burn:

* **Open** — All permitted and recreational fires are allowed
* **Closed** — No permitted burns. Recreational fires may be allowed unless restrictive conditions exist
* **Burn Ban** — No recreational fires, beach fires, or outdoor burning of any kind

**Fireworks are banned throughout San Juan County year-round.**

---

## Recreational Campfires

No permit required, but you must follow these rules:

* Fire size: 3 feet or less in diameter
* Flame height: 3 feet or less
* Clear area: 2 feet minimum around the fire
* Fuel: Only clean, dry firewood

**During restricted periods:** Only propane-fueled appliances (BBQs, outdoor fireplaces, patio heaters) and pellet grills are allowed. No charcoal, firewood fires, or open-flame devices like tiki torches.

---

## Residential Burn Permits

For burning natural vegetation like yard debris and brush piles.

**Cost:** $20, valid for the entire burn season

**Requirements:**
* Burn only natural, unprocessed vegetation
* Keep permit on-site during the burn
* Have suppression equipment ready

**Pile size limits:**
* With charged water hose on-site: Up to 10 ft diameter × 6 ft high
* Without hose (two 5-gallon buckets of water required): Up to 5 ft diameter × 5 ft high
* A shovel or comparable tool must always be on-site

---

## Commercial Burn Permits

For large-scale vegetation clearing on commercial or agricultural properties.

**Cost:** $250, valid for 30 days

**Requirements:**
* On-site inspection required before permit issuance

## Your Responsibilities

When you obtain a burn permit, you agree to:

* Know and follow all permit conditions
* Check the current fire danger rating before burning
* Have the permit in hand during the burn
* Provide manpower and equipment to suppress escaped fires
* Reimburse fire agencies for suppression costs if your fire escapes

**The person attending the burn is responsible**—not just the permit holder or property owner.

## State and National Parks

State Parks and San Juan Island National Historical Park may suspend all burning during extreme conditions, including BBQs, fire pits, and even pressurized gas grills. Check with park rangers before planning any outdoor cooking during fire season.
